AI-Assistant

I'm tired of managing my calendar, emails, and daily tasks manually, and of limited assistants like Alexa. That’s why I want to build my own AI voice assistant, inspired by iron man's Jarvis, i want to create a voice assistant that's smart and that can help me with all my everyday tasks

# Features (Planned and In Progress)

- Help manage my everyday tasks and projects

- Sync with my calendar to show, add, and remove events easily

- Connect to robots (like one that can bring me tools — still in progress)

- Use ChatGPT (or similar models) for smart, contextual responses

- Integrate with Telegram so I can interact with it from my phone

- Display information visually on my PC when needed
