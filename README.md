# AI-Assistant

I'm tired of managing my calendar, emails, and daily tasks manually, and of limited assistants like Alexa. That’s why I want to build my own AI voice assistant, inspired by Iron Man's Jarvis, I want to create a smart voice assistant that can help me with all my everyday tasks and more

# Features (Planned and In Progress)

- Help manage my everyday tasks and projects

- Sync with my calendar to show, add, and remove events easily

- Connect to robots (like one that can bring me tools — still in progress)

- Use Chatgpt (or similar models) for smart, contextual responses

- Integrate with Telegram so I can interact with it from my phone

- Display information visually on my PC when needed
